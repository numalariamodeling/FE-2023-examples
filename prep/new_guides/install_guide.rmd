## Installation Methods

Below are instructions on how to install emodpy from the terminal, particularly for use on QUEST, or other linux-based clusters. The following instructions are specific to QUEST but can easily be adapted to other clusters or HPCs that use SLURM scheduling. There is an existing virtual environments (emodpy_alt) that is up-to-date on b1139 and available for team use. If choosing to use these it is recommended that you set up an alias in your `.bashrc` file for ease of access, but otherwise require no installation. However, if you would like to use your own virtual environment or version of emodpy/idmtools you can use these to setup on your home directory.

### Prerequisites, Login, Load Python

1. Review prerequisites and recommendations. 
    a. https://docs.idmod.org/projects/idmtools/en/latest/platforms/slurm/index.html#prerequisites 
    b. https://docs.idmod.org/projects/idmtools/en/latest/platforms/slurm/index.html#recommendations 

2. Login/SSH to Slurm cluster (QUEST). You can either use FastX or directly SSH from terminal prompt, like the following: 


    ``` bash
    ssh –X <usernamehere>@quest.northwestern.edu 
    ```

3. Load Python module 3.9.16, at terminal prompt, type the following: 
    - *NOTE: idmtools requires Python 3.9 or higher. This is the reason for loading Python 3.9.16, which is available on QUEST; however, QUEST currently defaults to Python 3.6.x.* 

    ``` bash
    module load python/3.9.16
    ```

4. Pull Singularity image containing Python and MPI (used by emodpy-malaria tasks) 

    - *NOTE: this sif file already exists in `/projects/b1139/images/dtk_run_rocky_py39.sif` and does not need to be reinstalled if you have access to the project*

    ``` bash
    curl https://packages.idmod.org:443/artifactory/idm-docker-public/idmtools/rocky_mpi/dtk_run_rocky_py39.sif -o dtk_run_rocky_py39.sif
    ```

### Installation with Virtual Environment – `SLURM_LOCAL` Mode

*NOTE: A shared environment exists in /projects/b1139/environments/emodpy_alt for `SLURM_LOCAL`. The following instructions will teach you how to make your own installation if desired*

1. Create a Python virtual environment, unload Python module, and activate virtual environment, which is named “myvenv” in the following: 
    - *NOTE: you may name the environment anything you like, "myvenv" is just an example*

    ``` bash
    python3 -m venv <myvenv> 
    module unload python/3.9.16
    source ./<myvenv>/bin/activate 
    ```
    - *NOTE: The following step is only needed when a new idmtools Singularity image is available and you’ve previously installed packages in your home directory. This cleans up local packages from previous installations inside Singularity container*

    ``` bash
    rm –fr ~/.local/lib/python* 
    ```

2. Install emodpy-malaria and idmtools_platform_slurm

    ``` python
    pip3 install emodpy-malaria --index-url=https://packages.idmod.org/api/pypi/pypi-production/simple 
   
    pip3 install idmtools_platform_slurm --index-url=https://packages.idmod.org/api/pypi/pypi-production/simple
    ```    

3. During installation of the shared venv on b1139, some issues arose that cause the installation to quit unexpectedly. This is seemingly an issue with access to the libgit2 module to build the pygit wheel. Libgit2 was installed within the emodpy_alt venv folder using these [instructions](https://github.com/libgit2/pygit2/blob/master/docs/install.rst#libgit2-within-a-virtual-environment). As it is now available, installation should hopefully avoid these issues in the future but it could occur with personal venvs (if team members choose to create their own environments).
    - *NOTE: The above installation instructions are for emodpy-malaria, which includes installing idmtools and other dependencies by referencing the requirements.txt when using pip install. For more information on requirements.txt and pip install, see https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#using-requirements-files*
